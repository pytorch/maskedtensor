MaskedTensor
========================================

This library is a part of the `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`_ project. Please note that this library is currently 
classified as a prototype -- that is, this library is at an early stage for feedback and testing, and we encourage
users to submit any issues they may encounter, feature requests, etc. The Github can be found `here <https://github.com/pytorch/maskedtensor>`_.

The purpose of :mod:`maskedtensor` is to serve as an extension to `torch.Tensor`, especially in cases of:

* using any masked semantics (e.g. variable length tensors, nan* operators, etc.)
* differentiation between 0 and NaN gradients
* various sparse applications (see tutorial)

More details can be found in the Overview tutorial.
