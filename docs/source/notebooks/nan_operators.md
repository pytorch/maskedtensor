### [Issue 21987](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/21987)

+++

This issue was closed by inclusion into [Issue 61474 - Implement missing torch.nan\* operators](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/61474). This proposes an alternative, which is to use masked tensors instead of introducing additional operators. Since nanmean [has already landed](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/21987), we can use it as a comparison point.

```{code-cell} ipython3
y = torch.arange(32).float()
x = y * y.fmod(4)
x = x.masked_fill(x == 0, float('nan'))
print(x)
print(torch.nanmean(x))
print(torch.mean(masked_tensor(x, ~torch.isnan(x))))
```

MaskedTensor can further support reduction when fully masked out, as would be the case when a given Tensor is completetely nan. nanmean on the other hand returns nan when the input is entirely nan.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = torch.empty(32)
x.fill_(float('nan'))
print(x)
print(torch.nanmean(x))
print(torch.mean(masked_tensor(x, ~torch.isnan(x))))
```

Further [some users](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/63870) already want to use nan reductions to encode masked semantics.

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
